            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ana Grosu, and I'm currently studying web development at Bellevue College. I have a passion for creating websites and learning new technologies. You could say Iâ€™m trying to debug my way to greatness!</p>
            <p>My academic and professional goals? Well, I aim to become a full-stack developer. It's a tall order, but I hear the view from the top of the stack is amazing. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you might find me telling HTML puns. Want to hear one? Why did the web developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache!</p>
            <p>Join me on my journey as I code my way through exciting projects and learn the ins and outs of web development. Together, we'll create websites that are user-friendly, efficient, and maybe even a bit humorous. After all, a byte of laughter can go a long way in tech!</p>
